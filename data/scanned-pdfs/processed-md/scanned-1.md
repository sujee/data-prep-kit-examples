Non-text-searchable PDF

This is an example of a non-text-searchable PDF . Because it was created from an image rather than a text document, it cannot be rendered as plain text by the PDF reader. Thus, attempting to select the text on the page as though it were a text document or website will not work, regardless of how neatly it is organized.
