Dear Pete,

Permit me to introduce you to the facility of facsimile transmission.

In facsimile a photocell is caused to perform a raster scan over the subject copy \_ Ihe variations of print density on the document cause the photocell to generate an analogous electrical video signal\_ This signal is used to modulate a carrier, which is transmitted to a remote destination over a radio or cable communications link \_

At the remote terminal demodulation reconstructs the video signal, which is used to modulate the density of print produced by a printing device \_ Ihis device is scanning in a raster scan synchronised with that at the transmitting terminal\_ As a result, a facsinile copy of the subject document is produced .

Probably you have uses for this facility in your organisation\_

Yours sincerely,
